Initialization:
* Rework CFG to be updated with any CLI args that have overridden the values (but do not save the cfg file).

UI:
* Clean up DL Engine listener thread prior to quitting.
* Fix MP4 displaying issue (!display)
* When exiting, take a final inventory.
* Check and debug errors when scaling images:
  >> QPixmap::scaled: Pixmap is a null pixmap
  >> qt.gui.icc: fromIccProfile: failed minimal tag size sanity
* Have windows scroll with additional output.
* On exit, if the DL thread is active, run the inventory.


GENERAL:
* Address all documentation TODOs
* Strange output errors from pyperclip - saves URL, but filename is munged. Can be corrected manually by reDL'ing and updating file.
* Paths being duplicated (see view_inventory, remove list(set()) from record.__str__.

STORAGE:
# Make DB indices dynamic (config file or read from DB host)
