Initialization:
* Rework CFG to be updated with any CLI args that have overridden the values (but do not save the cfg file).

UI:
* Clean up DL Engine listener thread prior to quitting.
* Add tabbed view in primary view.
* Fix MP4 displaying issue (!display)

GENERAL:
* Address all documentation TODOs
* Strange output errors from pyperclip - saves URL, but filename is munged. Can be corrected manually by reDL'ing and updating file.
